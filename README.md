# Ball-And-Beam
Interface for PID Controller

A PID controller was utilized in order to balance the ball upon a surface, a Webcam was responsible for detecting the ball, working just like the controller's "eyes".

An interface was programmed in Java, through the software Processing. All the PID's processes are realized on the PC so that the Arduino is only in charge of receving the output of the controller and update the Servo-Motor's position.
